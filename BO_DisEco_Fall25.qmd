Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her\
data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She\
meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of\
affected elk are as follows:

## Lab Activity Report

Tick identification is a unique and complex set of parameters that allow researchers to accurately identify potential vectors for a variety of zoonotic diseases. One of the primary methods used to determine a tick's species is the SAM method, which stands for Scutum, Anal Groove, and Mouthparts. The scutum refers to the plate on the back of a tick; in females, they will display a scutum anterior and an alloscutum posterior. For the Anal Groove, we are looking to determine whether it is anterior or posterior. Finally, the mouthparts is referring to the length of the protrusions from the mouth. This part is particularly subjective because these occur in a variety of sizes, and different people may have different definitions of what makes something long vs. short. Additionally, another determining factor is the number of legs that the tick has; nymphs and adult ticks have 8 legs, while larvae only 6 legs. These particular determinants allow both researchers and public health workers to accurately and rapidly identify what ticks are affecting a certain area or population. This is especially important as ticks are a vector for a variety of diseases, such as Lyme Disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. So, the identification of these ticks is paramount in seeing what possible diseases a population is susceptible and preparing for possible outbreaks of said diseases.

## Exam Corrections

### Question 1 (9/18 points)

1b. Using disease models, we can make accurate predictions of how a disease will spread in a real-world host population

Answer: False; we cannot make accurate predictions of how a disease will spread in a real-world host population because real-world populations violate many of the rules set by disease models (e.g., populations are open and will have births and natural deaths that will affect the susceptible proportion of a population, etc.)

1c. Chagas' disease is a protozoal disease that is commonly transmitted by the triatomine bug (Kissing bug). It can also be transmitted by the consumption of contaminated food or beverages (infected with the feces of triatomine bugs). Chagas' disease is therefore a contagious disease.

Answer: False; While Chagas' disease is infectious, it is not contagious. Infection must happen by way of a vector and human-to-human contact has not been reported, making it a non-contagious disease.

1f. The deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) infected with Sin Nombre Virus do not show any clinical signs, but excrete the virus in their urine, feces and saliva. Humans get infected via aerosolized droppings of an infected rodent. The illness caused by Sin Nombre virus in humans is called Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). HPS is therefore a vector-transmitted disease.

Answer: False; HPS is not vector-transmitted because the mice are considered to be reservoir hosts. Reservoir hosts are responsible for maintaining a pathogen's prevalence in the environment with some spillover into other hosts, while vectors will predominantly act as a way to transmit the pathogen between hosts.

### Question 7 (12/20 points)

7\. In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelop occurred in Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scale deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelope from extinction due to disease outbreaks.

Answer: In 2015, a mass-die off was caused in Saiga antelope by a bacteria that naturally inhabits the respiratory tract: *Pasteurella multocida*. This bacteria normally causes no pathology in the antelope and has largely been considered a commensal organism that lives in synchrony with the Saiga. However, unusually high levels of humidity and temperature created a physiological response in the antelope, allowing bacteria to multiply rapidly and enter circulation and resulting in septicemia. Unfortunately, this happened in conjunction with the predetermined breeding/calving season for the antelope and allowed the pathogen to spread rapidly in the large herds gathered for breeding, resulting in a large proportion of the population dying from septic pasteurellosis. To prevent mass die-off events like this in the future, researchers need to more adequately monitor the environmental conditions that could trigger another die-off, implement further disease surveillance for these herds, and have access to rapid-response teams that can quickly quarantine and treat infected animals before another outbreak can begin. In terms of a broader fix to the problem, we need to engage in more extensive conservation efforts to maintain and protect the Saiga's natural habitat from rapid fluctuations in climate.

**MERS-CoV\
**Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April 2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)![](images/MERS-CoV%20img.png){width="897"}

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)

    A.  **Incorrect; The pathogen MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in camel populations. Humans are a spillover event, but long term human-to-human transmission cannot be sustained.**

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

    A.  **Correct**

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

    A.  **Incorrect; MERS-CoV can be spread from human-to-human, but not widespread enough for a potential epidemic.**

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)

    A.  **Incorrect; MERS-CoV has an estimated case fatality rate of approximately 35%.**

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)

    A.  **Correct; however, from the curve it appears to be multiple point-source outbreaks with little to no sustained transmission following the initial outbreak.**

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**\
The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda\
probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit\
bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of\
Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health\
care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

\
1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,\
would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging\
infectious disease? Justify your classification. 5 points

**Answer: As there are cases of human to human transmission, I would classify this as a emerging infectious disease. This refers to a scenario where the pathogen can persist in the secondary host, but transmission is low due to little to no interaction with the reservoir host. Another example for this would be something like the acute coronavirus syndromes that can be passed from wild civets in China to humans where it will spread human to human; however, due to low contact rates between humans and wild civets, the prevalence of animal to human transmission is low, keeping the disease from rapidly spreading in the new host.**

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both\
community and healthcare settings? 5 points

**Answer: In community, avoidance of areas typically claimed by bats that are known to harbor Marburg virus should be avoided. In a healthcare setting, stringent contact precautions should be in place to protect healthcare workers from potential contact with infected bodily fluids, such as saliva or blood.**

## Nipah Virus

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.**(8 points)**

**Answer:** In areas like Malaysia and Singapore, Nipah virus (NiV) is documented as being transmitted via interaction with infected livestock animals; these livestock animal are typically infected by interaction with infected bats or with partially consumed fruits that the bats will leave the virus in. In Bangladesh, outbreaks are typically associated with the consumption of infected date from date palms or from the sap collected from these trees. Similar to the Malaysian outbreaks, this is associated with infected bats partially consuming date/palm sap and leaving droppings in the receptacles used to collect date palm sap. In cases like the Malaysian outbreaks, the recommendation would be to conserve natural habitats so that farmland does not encroach, leading to fewer interactions between bats and humans, as well as the bats and livestock/their food source. For the Bangladesh outbreaks, prevention is largely associated with controlling the production, through means of safer collection methods, and consumption of date palm sap.

## Avian Reovirus

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population. **(6 points)**

**Answer:** Typically, Avian reoviruses (ARVs) are transmitted either horizontally through a fecal-oral route or vertically from hen-to-egg. In terms of horizontal transmission, this is largely impacted by poor upkeep and overcrowding of the chicken/turkeys habitat as it can quickly lead to an infected food or water source; this is compounded by the fact that the virus can survive for weeks outside of the host in the environment. For vertical transmission, one factor that could increase the rate of transmission would be a poor vaccination routine for the hens. The most significant characteristic this virus exhibits that allows for it to be effectively transmitted would be its ability to persist in the environment without a host in poorly maintained conditions, allowing the environment to become a reservoir for the pathogen and causing exponentially more infections. One instance of this in wild birds that is largely associated with an ARV infection is that of mass corvid die-offs caused by avian orthoreovirus (aORV). Infections of aORV are increasingly common in the winter months and will usually lead to mass die-off events where entire populations of crows can and have been decimated.

## Langya henipavirus

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? **(6 points)**

**Answer:** The Langya henipavirus (LayV) likely utilizes wild shrews in rural China as a reservoir host. The route of transmission from shrew-to-shrew is still nebulous and uncertain, but it is believed that humans acquire LayV in a spillover event caused by direct (or possibly indirect) contact with an infected animal or its bodily fluids, somewhat similar in transmission to that of Sin Nombre Virus. While there are reported cases of LayV in humans, it is only considered a spillover event and not an emerging infectious disease because there is no reported instance of transmission from human-to-human, meaning that we are dead end hosts.

**Comparison of Prevalences by Sex (using Fisher's exact test):** p = 0.0087

## Analysis

In comparing the prevalences of B. procyonis across a variety of determinants, there are some aspects that reveal themselves that will help us to better understand the distribution and potential risks of infection for this pathogen. To start, the prevalences that were collected from each region were compared to one another. Notably, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of infected hosts in the the Northern Region when contrasted against the Southern and Central Regions (*p* \< 0.05). Moreover, when there were infections, the average worm burden was markedly higher in the Southern and Central regions, with average worm burden being approximately 7 worms, when compared to the Northern Region, with an average worm burden of only 1 worm. This implies that there is some reasons that the disease is more readily able to proliferate in the other regions, potentially related to the changes in temperature during winter months as this data was collected from November to February. One possibility is that the raccoons in the Northern Region may be entering a state of torpor (similar to hibernation) during colder months in which the parasite would not be able to proliferate in the host. While there did not seem to be any evidence of there being significant difference between the prevalence of this disease based on age, there does seem to be a significant increase (*p* \< 0.05) in the prevalence in female raccoons when compared to their male counterparts. Interestingly, the female raccoons that were tested were also the ones that showed the higher worm burden on average compared to males; they also were the cases that had the most worms extracted during necropsy with some raccoons having upwards of 45 worms. This adds an interesting layer of complexity to this disease system as it is seemingly preferentially targeting, or at least proliferating more in, female raccoon hosts.
