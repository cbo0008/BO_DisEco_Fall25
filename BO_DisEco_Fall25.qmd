Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius?

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

```

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

Answer: **We would need to sample 59 deer** **to be able to accurately detect this disease with 95% confidence.**

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Answer: **In group A, we would need to test approximately 300 individuals, while in group B, we would need to approximately 225 individuals.**

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this\
finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
\_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

Answer: **The prevalence of exposure in this facility is \< 1%.**
