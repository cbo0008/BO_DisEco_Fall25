Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius?

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

```

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

Answer: **We would need to sample 59 deer** **to be able to accurately detect this disease with 95% confidence.**

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population\
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Answer: **In group A, we would need to test approximately 300 individuals, while in group B, we would need to approximately 225 individuals.**

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this\
finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
\_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%.

Answer: **The prevalence of exposure in this facility is \< 1%.**

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her\
data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10th June 2025. She\
meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of\
affected elk are as follows:

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were\
no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

### A) Answer: 0.555, 1, and 0 cases/elk-day, respectively

#### Work:

##### 6/12/25: 

Total susceptible population: 9

New Cases: 5

Incidence = New cases/total susceptible population

Incidence = 0.555 cases/elk-day

##### 6/14/25: 

Total susceptible population: 2

New Cases: 2

Incidence = New cases/total susceptible population

Incidence = 1 case/elk-day

##### 6/15/25: 

Total susceptible population: 0

New Cases: 0

Incidence = New cases/total susceptible population

Incidence = 0 cases/elk-day

### B) Answer: 85.7% and 35.7%, respectively

#### Work:

##### 06/13/25

Total Population: 14

\# of cases: 12

Prevalence = \# of cases/Total Population

Prevalence = 85.7% of the population

##### 06/16/25

Total Population: 14

\# of cases: 5

Prevalence = \# of cases/Total Population

Prevalence = 35.7% of the population

### C) Answer: They are both 0.0714 on Day 1 (6/10/25)

#### Work:

Total susceptible population: 14

New Cases: 1

Incidence = New cases/total susceptible population

Incidence = 0.0714 case/elk-day

Total Population: 14

\# of cases: 1

Prevalence = \# of cases/Total Population

Prevalence = 7.14% of the population

### D) Answer: 6/16/25

#### Work: See above (A)
